Data Scientist, Ph.D. candidate in Theoretical Physics and Machine Learning student, I have experience in Data Analysis, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am a person with a self-taught profile, I always value teamwork and I seek to cooperate and help everyone in the best way possible, with great satisfaction in listening, learning and teaching. I have passion and great facility for dealing with numbers, mathematical modeling and programming.

### Tools

* The programming language I master is Python. In addition, I had the opportunity to work with several programming languages ​​in my professional life, such as R, C/C++, Fortran, Matlab/Scilab, Wolfram Mathematica and PHP. Soon I will be starting my studies in Kotlin and Julia.
* SQL, with experience in MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite and also some experience with NoSQL in MongoDB.
* I have a background in Git, with personal repositories on GitHub and collaborative work on GitLab.
* Advanced knowledge of Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Numpy libraries.
* I always use TensorFlow for models that require Neural Networks.
* For statistical tests, I use Scipy and Statsmodels
* Advanced knowledge of Microsoft Office
* Experience in AWS for cloud services
* For Business Intelligence dashboards, I have experience using AWS QuickSight and Microsoft PowerBI
* I use DVC with GitFlow for data versioning and experiments
* Over the past year, I have been deepening my knowledge of the Hadoop ecosystem for using PySpark.
* Also, I have basic knowledge of Front-End and dealing with JavaScript, HTML5 or CSS codes are not an impediment for me.

### Achievements

* IBM Professional Certification in Data Science. [View credential](https://coursera.org/share/bcd6985917ab245c475e58b42da33d06)
* Experience with scientific research, having published in international journals ​
* Participation in the development team of a credit monitoring model at RisKnow
* Kaggle notebook expert profile. [Link to profile](https://www.kaggle.com/emdemor)
